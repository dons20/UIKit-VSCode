# Version 1.6.0 (April 17, 2025)

This version re-introduces snippet language association which was removed in v1.4.0. All languages that support HTML-like markup should now support the snippets. This was done to address the concern from many users regarding snippets coming up in all files unless the extension was disabled. Thanks to a bit of AI assistance, I was able to find most of the outliers which makes this more reliable. Thank you for the feedback!

If there is a language that you want to see snippets supported in, feel free to raise a PR or an [issue](https://github.com/dons20/UIKit-VSCode/issues).

* 🔧 Fixed an incorrect snippet trigger for `uk-parallax-start-end`

* 💡 Updated the Github Readme to fix the broken badges, preview images, missing entries, and other small details.

# Version 1.5.0 (April 5, 2025)

Thank you for using this extension, here's a little update for you.

* 🔧 Fixed an issue with selectable options in snippets
  * Technical: For selectable snippets with the `$0` index, the list of options would simply be inserted, instead of putting the cursor at the location and displaying the list as expected.

* 💡 Updated to UIkit 3.22.1 for base snippets

* 💡 Updated multiple props across various components from 3.5.10 until 3.15.0
  * More snippets coming soon

## Contributions
* [Jakob Pless @pless84](https://github.com/pless84): 💡 Updated to UIkit 3.0.3 - [PR #18](https://github.com/dons20/UIKit-VSCode/pull/18)

# Version 1.4.0 (November 3, 2018)
* ⚙️️️ Modified main snippets to be global by default
  * There are many languages and associated files that the snippets wouldn't trigger in, and so this change will now allow `uk-` snippets to work in any file.
  * This change does not apply to the javascript-only snippets. Those will retain their original functionality within `javascript` files to avoid clutter.
  * To prevent this from occurring, simply disable the extension for that workspace, or until you need to re-activate it.
  * If this change comes with any issues or inconveniences, let me know on the [issues](https://github.com/dons20/UIKit-VSCode/issues) page!
* 💡 Updated to UIkit 3.0.0 RC 20

  * Please note that a few of the snippet choices will be inactive/slightly bugged until the August VSCode update [due to a bug which has been fixed](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31599) for the next build.
  * A large number of snippets have recieved changes or minor tweaks. There are too many to list in this changelog, but any snippets which include multiple options will now utilize this new system.
