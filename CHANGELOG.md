  * Please note that a few of the snippet choices will be inactive/slightly bugged until the August VSCode update [due to a bug which has been fixed](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31599) for the next build.
  * A large number of snippets have recieved changes or minor tweaks. There are too many to list in this changelog, but any snippets which include multiple options will now utilize this new system.

* ✅ Added new method snippets to JS snippets. (e.g. `uk-modal-methods`, `uk-drop-methods`, etc.)

* 🔧 Fixed a few broken snippets
